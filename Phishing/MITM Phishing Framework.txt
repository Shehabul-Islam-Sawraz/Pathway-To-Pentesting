‚ñ™Ô∏èEvilginx (MITM Phishing Framework)

evilginx2 is a man-in-the-middle attack framework used for phishing login credentials along with session cookies,
which in turn allows to bypass 2-factor authentication protection.

This tool is a successor to Evilginx, released in 2017, which used a custom version of nginx HTTP server to provide 
man-in-the-middle functionality to act as a proxy between a browser and phished website. Present version is fully 
written in GO as a standalone application, which implements its own HTTP and DNS server, making it extremely easy 
to set up and use.
